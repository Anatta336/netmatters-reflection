# HTML and CSS Reflection

## Usage
On first cloning this repository certain essential files will not be present and should be generated.

Assuming you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) installed on your machine, execute these commands from the root directory of the project:
* `npm update`
* `sass scss:css`

You should now have a `/css/styles.css` file.
